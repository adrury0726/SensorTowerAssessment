This is a project I built using C# and .NET framework. I took the provided list of Advertisement companies located in the TextFiles folder and had them be compared using a threshold. Overall what it does is check the threshold, 
which checks for how similar a company is with every company in the list, and then writes it to the console letting the user see which companies are being compared, as well as how similar they are.
